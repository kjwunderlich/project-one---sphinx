First group project for data analytics bootcamp

Please use the jupyter notebook "Phylanthropy_Data_Analysis.ipynb" to review the analysis of the Donor's Source of Wealth and the donation amount over the last 4 years.

With regard to the correlation between donor source of wealth and amount of money given over the course the four years 2015 to 2018:

The largest donation of $1.8 billion was made to a Chan Zuckerberg Foundation from Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan in 2017. Their source of wealth was in Technology. Notably their residence of California is of no surprise.

The wealth category groupings were bucketed to allow for distinction among 192 unique strings of 2 or more sources of wealth. This created 13 distinct categories and these were used to identify wealth source. A separate csv cross reference file was created and saved to the master repository.

Overall 95% of all donations came from Technology followed by Manufacturing, Family Wealth and Real Estate.

There was a relatinship found with a donors source of wealth and their donation amount. Wealth categories that command more value in the market yielded higher donations. Healthcare and Retail sources of wealth yeilded nearly identical amounts of donations over the 4 years with Transportation and Education being the lowest.
