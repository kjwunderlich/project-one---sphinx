QUESTION -	What types of causes receive the most money?

This notebook looks at the correlation between the type of donation and the amount of money given. It features two main graphs, showing the total amount of donations for 2015 - 2018 broken down by cause type and the yearly change in donation amounts for the top five highest earning causes over the course of four years.

The data was pulled from the Chronicle of Philanthropy, put into four seperate csv files and read into the notebook for analysis. It revealed that the top five recent highest earning causes are:

Colleges and universities, 
Health, 
Foundations, 
Arts, 
Community foundations

Colleges and universities is by far the highest earning cause, with a four year total of over $20 billion. There was also an interesting uptick in the donations to foundations in 2017, with a massive uptick from roughly half a billion in 2016 to 4 billion in 2017 and then a return to about half a billion in 2018. Health also saw an uptick in donations in 2017, growing from 1 to 2 billion from 2016 - 2017. 

NOTE: 2018 donation numbers will be lower than final numbers as the year has not ended yet.
